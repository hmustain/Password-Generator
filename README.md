# Password-Generator

## Description
There is not a single page on the web you visit today that doesn't require a unique password. The motivation for this page, was to create a password generator that will help me come up with something unique to satisfy most any password requirement out there today.
I built this project, to be able to help me come up with a unique password for all of the many websites out there today that require a unique password.
By having this site, I am having to solve the problem of trying to come up with a crazy, unique password from your head.
Building this project, I was able to take the skills we have learned in JavaScript this week and apply them to real life application. Some of the JavaScript skills learned are included, but not limited to the below list:
-Functions
-Variables 
-Conditional Statements
-Window Prompts, alerts, confirm.
-Arrays
-For Loops
-Math.Floor / Random
-How to join arrays
